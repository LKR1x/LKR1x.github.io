When you open a new tab on a browser, it is often full of things you don't need. There are sponsored links, news stories, and other distractions. This important space should be a calm and useful starting point for work. But instead, it makes it hard to focus because users cannot control what they see.

## My Goal

I wanted to fix this problem by creating a browser extension. My goal was to build a new tab page that is beautiful, personal, and helps you be productive. A page that you control completely, without any distractions. This idea became **Fresh Tab**.

## My Solution: Fresh Tab

I designed Fresh Tab to be minimal, fast, and very personal. It gives you a clean and calm space with simple tools that help you work better. I started with a basic wireframe to plan the layout.

Here are the main features I built to solve the problem:

* **Quick Shortcuts:** To make browsing faster, I added a command panel. You can set a short command for your favorite website (like "yt" for YouTube). Then, you just type `/yt` to go there instantly. This saves a lot of time by reducing mouse clicks.

* **Simple Notes:** It is helpful to write down quick thoughts or to-do tasks. So, I added a small notes section right under the clock. It’s a simple way to keep important reminders in a place you will see often.

* **Full Personalization:** To make the new tab feel like your own, I added many ways to customize it. You can set your own wallpaper, add a blur effect to make text easier to read, or just use a simple color. You can also change the clock from 12-hour to 24-hour format.

* **Custom Bookmarks & Search:** You can add up to 20 of your most-used websites right on the homepage for easy access. I also added an option to choose your favorite search engine, so your search experience is exactly how you like it.

* **Backup & Restore:** After you make your perfect dashboard, you shouldn't have to do it again. I built a feature to export all your settings—shortcuts, notes, and wallpaper—into one file. If you move to a new computer, you can import this file to get your setup back in seconds.

## The Final Result

The final result is Fresh Tab, a clean and fast new tab page that works for you, not against you. It turns a distracting space into a personal productivity hub. It puts you back in control and makes the browsing experience more focused and enjoyable.
