University students get information from many different places every dayâ€”social media, websites, emails, and notice boards. It's messy and easy to miss important updates. There is no single, trusted app where students can find all the university, academic, and sports news in one organized place.

## My Goal

My goal was to design a modern and user-friendly mobile app to solve this problem. I wanted to create a one-stop platform that helps students stay updated without feeling overwhelmed. The app needed to be simple, engaging, and designed specifically for a student's busy life.

## My Design Process and Solution

I used **Adobe XD** for the entire design process. My first step was to create low-fidelity wireframes to build the basic structure and flow of the app. This helped me plan where all the key elements would go.

After wireframing, I designed the final screens, focusing on making the experience as smooth as possible for students.

### 1. Simple Onboarding and A Smarter Registration

The app starts with a clean splash screen and a welcome page for first-time users. I designed the login screen to be straightforward.

For the **Register Screen**, I made a specific design choice: I removed the "Confirm Password" field. **Why?** University students are very familiar with technology. They can easily use the password visibility toggle to check their password if needed. This makes the sign-up process one step shorter and faster, which improves the user experience. An OTP screen was also added to verify the user's email for security.

### 2. A Home Screen Powered by Students

The **Home Screen** is the heart of the app. It is organized with a simple bottom navigation bar to switch between **University**, **Academic**, and **Sports** news. The most important feature here is the "Top News" section. This isn't decided by an admin, but by the students themselves. News with the most positive reactions from students automatically moves to the top, ensuring the most relevant content is seen first.

### 3. An Interactive and Accessible News View

When a student opens a news item, the layout is clean and easy to read. I included three key features here:
* **Reaction Button:** Allows students to vote for useful news.
* **Share Button:** Makes it easy to share information with friends.
* **Read-Aloud Button:** This is an important accessibility feature. It lets students listen to the news hands-free, which is perfect for when they are walking or multitasking.

## The Final Result

The final design is a clean, intuitive, and student-focused app that solves the problem of scattered information. By focusing on smart design choices like a faster registration, student-curated news, and accessibility features, the app provides a practical and seamless experience. It gives students a reliable way to stay informed about everything happening at their university.
