In our community, many farmers work incredibly hard but often struggle to get a fair and stable price for their harvest. There isn't a simple, local mobile app that connects them directly to buyers. At the same time, new farmers and learners need good guidance, but finding reliable information is difficult. A single tool that brings buying, selling, and guidance together could make a big difference.

## My Goal and Role in the Team

Our group, a mix of ICT and agriculture-technology students, created the "Koratuwa" app to solve these problems. Our goal was to build a platform that helps farmers sell their produce for a fair price and get farming advice easily.

As the team's **UI/UX Designer**, my specific role was to design the entire user experience. I planned all the screens, created the wireframes, and designed the final user interface in Adobe XD, making sure the app was as easy to use as possible for our target users.

## My Design Process and Solution

Before starting any design, I focused on understanding our primary user: local farmers. Many have low English skills and need an app that is extremely simple and clear. This led to my core design principles:

* **Simple is Best:** The UI must be very clean, with big text, large buttons, and no heavy or confusing graphics.
* **Language First:** Users must be able to choose their local language (Sinhala or Tamil) right at the start.
* **Easy for Thumbs:** All important buttons and controls should be placed at the bottom of the screen, within easy reach of the thumb.
* **Less Typing, Fewer Mistakes:** Use forms with dropdown menus wherever possible to reduce typing errors.

### 1. Planning the Foundation (Wireframes)

I started by creating low-fidelity wireframes. This allowed our team to agree on the app's structure and flow before I moved on to the detailed visual design.

### 2. Designing the User Experience, Screen by Screen

I designed each screen with our farmers in mind, focusing on clarity and ease of use.

#### A Welcoming Start: Language and Login
The very first screen a user sees is **Language Selection**. This is the most important first step, as many farmers are not comfortable with English. The Login screen is also kept simple, with large fields and a clear "Register" link.

#### A Clear and Simple Registration
To avoid overwhelming the user, I broke the registration process into two small steps.
* **Part 1** collects only personal details like name and address.
* **Part 2** is for setting up login information (email and password).
For farmers, I decided to keep the traditional two password fields ("Password" and "Re-enter Password"). This was a conscious choice to prioritize clarity and give them confidence that they entered their password correctly, even if it's a bit slower.

#### The Main Menu and Getting Guidance
The **Main Menu** acts as the central hub. All the main action buttons are designed as big, easy-to-understand icons and are placed at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access. The **Farming Guide** screen uses a simple form with dropdowns to help farmers get advice. This design makes it easy for them to input information and for our developers to use that data to provide accurate guidance.

#### A Transparent Marketplace to Sell Harvest
The **Market Price** screen uses a clean card layout to show the prices we pay for different fruits, making it easy to compare. To sell their harvest, farmers use the **Sell (Upload)** form. They can upload a picture and select the crop type from a dropdown list, which prevents spelling mistakes and helps our team manage inventory. The **History** screen then uses simple color codes (Green for Approved, Yellow for Pending, Red for Rejected) so farmers can quickly understand the status of their sale request.

## The Final Result

The final result is a user interface that is clean, practical, and built with deep empathy for its target users. The design directly addresses the challenges faced by local farmers by prioritizing local languages, large touch targets, a thumb-friendly layout, and simple forms. My work provided a strong visual and functional foundation for the development team to build an app that can genuinely support our agricultural community.
