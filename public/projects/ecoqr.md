When tourists and locals visit the beautiful natural sites of Sri Lanka, they often lack immediate access to information. They might stand before a unique plant or a place of interest but have no quick way to learn its story. The need for a special app or a complicated login process creates a barrier, preventing a seamless connection between the physical place and its rich digital information.

## My Goal and Role

This project was a community service idea initiative by University of Colombo Faculty of Art Leo Club. Our goal was simple: to create a web platform where a visitor could scan a QR code at a nature site and be taken directly to a beautiful and informative webpage about that location. No app installation, no login, just instant information.

In this group project, I worked as both the **UI/UX Designer** and a **Frontend Contributor**. I handled the complete design journey—from planning the user experience to creating the interface—and also built key components of the landing page, including the hero section and animations.

## My Process: From Design to Development

I knew this project needed a design that was both beautiful and extremely practical for someone using it outdoors on their phone.

### 1. Solving the Key UX Challenges

Before drawing a single screen, I identified the main challenges:
* **The Need for Speed:** A tourist won't wait to download an app or sign up. My solution was to make the experience entirely web-based. You scan, and you learn.
* **Mobile-First is a Must:** People explore with their phones. I focused on a responsive design with large, tappable buttons and clear, readable text that works perfectly on a small screen.
* **Rich Content, Simply Presented:** Each location has a lot of information. To avoid overwhelming users, I designed a card-based layout with collapsible sections, allowing people to scan key info first and dive deeper if they wish.

### 2. Designing the Experience in Figma

I started the design process in **Figma**. First, I created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user flow and page structure. Once the basic layout was solid, I developed high-fidelity prototypes, defining a simple and calm color palette that would be easy to read in outdoor light.

### 3. Building the Frontend with Next JS

After finalizing the design, I brought it to life using modern web technologies. I used **Next JS** for a fast and efficient user interface and **Tailwind CSS** to build the responsive layout quickly.
* **The Landing Page** features a beautiful hero section with a slider animation to showcase different eco-tourism spots, with clear instructions on how to use the QR scanner.

## The Final Result

The final product is a seamless, fast, and intuitive web platform that successfully connects physical locations with rich digital stories. By handling both the UI/UX design and frontend development, I was able to ensure that the final product was exactly as envisioned—a frictionless tool for education and exploration. This project demonstrates a complete design and development cycle, resulting in a valuable resource that promotes and protects Sri Lanka's natural treasures.
